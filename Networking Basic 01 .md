# Common methods of data Transmission
- Electrical signals- Transmission of data as electrical pulses on copper wire
- Optical signals- convert electrical signals in to light pulses and do the transmission
- Wireless signals- trasmission is achived by using infrared ,microwave or radio waves through the air
### Bandwidth and throughput
- bandwidth- capacity of a medium to carry data
    - kbps,Gbps  physical media properties ,current technologies
- Throughput- is  the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over given period of time
  - some factors influence throuhgput including
      - amount of data sent and receieve
      - type of data being trandmitted
