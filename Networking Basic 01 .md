# Common methods of data Transmission
- Electrical signals- Transmission of data as electrical pulses on copper wire
- Optical signals- convert electrical signals in to light pulses and do the transmission
- Wireless signals- trasmission is achived by using infrared ,microwave or radio waves through the air
### Bandwidth and throughput
- bandwidth- capacity of a medium to carry data
    - kbps,Gbps  physical media properties ,current technologies
- Throughput- is  the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over given period of time
  - some factors influence throuhgput including
      - amount of data sent and receieve
      - type of data being trandmitted
      - latency created by the number of network devices  encountered between source and destination
### Types of personal data
- Volenteer data
      - we know that data has been collected
- Inferred data
      - data genetated by our activities ex: while using atm card. so they catch our preferences where i used it 
- Observed data
      - using locations keep track the location
 
# Network Components, Types and Connections
 ### client and servers
 - a host can act as a client and a server or both depending on the software installed
 - host function as a client and the server on the network .this type of network call as peer to peer
    - advantage -easy set up , less complex ,low cost coz no server need  can use in simple tasks ,like transferfiles and shairing printers
    - disadvantage - no centralized administration, not secure , not scalable can be slower when act as a client and server
   
### Network infrastructures
    - end devices - printer ,computer, laptop, IP phone
    - Intermediate devices - Wireless router, LAN switch ,router, firewall , multilayer switch 
    - Network Media - LAN, WAN , Wireless
### ISP Services 
    - link the home natwork and internet
    - ex landline telephone service provider , smartphone service provider ,local cable provider
#### cable and DSL connection
    - cable - typically provide by television service providers , intenet data signals are coming in the same television delivery cable 
            - high bandwidth 
            - always on 
            - special cable modam use to seperate data  
    - DSL - Digital subscriber line - DSL runs over telephone line split into three channels 
            - telephone calls
            - faster download
            - sending and uploading info
            - use special modam to sepeate signals 
    - Also there are cellular, Satellite and Dial-up telephone as additional connectivity options

#### Other wireless networks
    - GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth ,NFC
